# Gender-Prediction-Based-on-Audio-Data
The following is an attempt to build an support vector machine (SVM) model to predict the gender of the speaker based on audio data.
After initial exploratory data analysis, SVM is chosen to be model that can be improved upon. 
Once SVM is built, sensitivity and specificity analysis followed. 
In addition to being a predictive model, I also wanted to explore the natural phenomenon that I am modeling after analyzing feature importance via SVM hyperplane coefficient.
