# Gender-Prediction-Based-on-Audio-Data
This project involves building a support vector machine (SVM) model to predict speaker gender based on audio data. Following exploratory data analysis, SVM was selected for its potential to be refined. After constructing the model, sensitivity and specificity analyses were performed. Beyond prediction, I aimed to understand the natural phenomenon by analyzing feature importance through SVM hyperplane coefficients.
